### Basic Component Rendering and Props
- Hello, World! Component: Create a simple component that displays the text "Hello, World!".
- Create a generic component that can display any type of data. Use a TypeScript interface to define the shape of the data that the component expects.
- Create a component that renders different content based on the type of a prop. Use TypeScript type guards to ensure type safety.
- User Profile: Build a component that renders a user's profile picture (provided as a URL) and name. Use props to pass in the image URL and name.
- Product List: Create a component to display a list of products. Each product should be an object containing a name, price, and description. Use a static array of products and iterate over it in JSX.
- To-Do List: Develop a component to show a list of to-do items. Each item should have a task and a completion status (boolean). Style completed tasks differently.
- Rating Stars: Build a component to display a rating system using stars, allowing users to select a rating for products (add rating to product).
- Simple Calculator: Build a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Implement the operations within a function.
- Contact List: Build a component to display a list of contacts. Each contact should be an object with a name, age, and occupation. Implement sorting by name and age.
- Tooltip: Implement a tooltip component that shows additional information when hovering over an element.
- Dropdown Menu: Implement a dropdown menu component with customizable options.
- Modal Window: Build a modal component that can be triggered and closed programmatically.
